# SunTzu-Background

Changes your backgroud with a random SunTzu quote (in French). 
Works with my 2560x1440 display but it will probably be trash with other resolutions

Usage
-----
Just run `python sun_tzu.py`

Language
--------
By default the language is French. Change it by replacing "quotes_new_fr.json" with "quotes.json" in the __main__ function

Example result
--------------
![Example](wallpaper.png?raw=true "Wallpaper")
